Most definitely not hardware

----

For current schematics (not necessarily matching last board spin!), see [Solens_Schematic.pdf](https://github.com/fluffylogiccu/solenshardware/blob/master/Altium/Solens/Project%20Outputs%20for%20Solens/Solens_Schematic.pdf)

For the current state of the board (board layers, overview, schematic, etc), see [Solens_All.pdf](https://github.com/fluffylogiccu/solenshardware/blob/master/Altium/Solens/Project%20Outputs%20for%20Solens/Solens_All.pdf)

For schematics and board files matching a particular spin, see [Releases](https://github.com/fluffylogiccu/solenshardware/releases). Each release has up-to-date Gerbers corresponding to the board files, as well as the matching BOM.
